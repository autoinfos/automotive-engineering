When applying for jobs, research the average salary in your area and for your level of experience. If you have a good track record or specialized skills, you may be able to negotiate a higher salary.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Negotiating HGV Driver Salary</h2><p>When I was looking for a new job as a HGV driver, I researched the average salary in my area and for my level of experience. I also highlighted my experience and any specialized skills I had, such as experience driving hazardous materials. This helped me negotiate a higher salary than what was initially offered.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: Can HGV drivers earn more by working for different employers?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, HGV drivers can earn more by working for companies that offer bonuses or overtime pay.
