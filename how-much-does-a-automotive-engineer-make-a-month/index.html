If so, you may be wondering how much you can expect to make each month. As with any career, the salary of an automotive engineer can vary based on a number of factors. In this post, we'll explore what you can expect to earn as an automotive engineer and what factors may impact your earnings.</p><h2>Pain Points Related to Automotive Engineer Salary</h2><p>One of the biggest pain points for those considering a career in automotive engineering is the uncertainty surrounding salary.

One is to do your research and determine what the average salary is for your position and location.
