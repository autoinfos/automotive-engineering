(with pictures)</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Have you ever wondered how much money entry level chemical engineers make? Perhaps you are considering a career in chemical engineering, or maybe you are a recent graduate searching for your first job. Either way, understanding the salary expectations for entry level chemical engineers can help you make informed decisions about your future.</p><p>One of the main pain points for individuals considering a career in chemical engineering is the fear of not making enough money. After all, college is expensive and the idea of entering the workforce with a low salary can be daunting. Additionally, some people may be concerned that their salary will not be enough to support their lifestyle or financial goals.</p><p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for chemical engineers in May 2020 was $108,540. The lowest 10 percent of chemical engineers earned less than $65,090, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $178,500. Entry level chemical engineers typically earn salaries on the lower end of this range, but the exact amount can vary based on factors such as location, industry, and level of education and experience.</p><p>In summary, entry level chemical engineers can expect to earn salaries in the range of $65,090 to $108,540 per year. However, it is important to keep in mind that this is just an estimate and individual salaries may vary.</p><h2>What Factors Affect Entry Level Chemical Engineering Salaries?</h2><p>When it comes to entry level chemical engineering salaries, there are several factors that can affect how much you can expect to earn. Here are a few of the most important:</p><h3>Location</h3><p>Where you work can have a big impact on your salary. In general, chemical engineers who work in large cities or areas with a high cost of living tend to earn more than those who work in smaller towns or rural areas. For example, a chemical engineer working in San Francisco can expect to earn significantly more than someone working in a small town in the Midwest.</p><h3>Industry</h3><p>The industry you work in can also have an impact on your salary. Chemical engineers who work in industries such as oil and gas or pharmaceuticals tend to earn more than those who work in other industries.</p><h4>Education and Experience</h4><p>Your level of education and experience can also play a role in how much you can expect to earn as an entry level chemical engineer. Individuals with advanced degrees or several years of experience in the field may be able to command higher salaries than those with less education or experience.</p><h2>Personal Experience: My Journey as an Entry Level Chemical Engineer</h2><p>When I graduated from college with a degree in chemical engineering, I was excited to start my career but also nervous about what my salary would be. I had heard horror stories about entry level salaries in other industries, so I wasn't sure what to expect.</p><p>However, I was pleasantly surprised when I received a job offer for a salary that was within the range I had been hoping for. Over the past few years, I have received regular raises and promotions that have allowed me to continue to grow my salary and advance my career.</p><p>Overall, I feel that my decision to pursue a career in chemical engineering has been a smart financial choice. While my salary may not be as high as some other professions, it is certainly enough to support my lifestyle and financial goals.</p><h2>What Are Some Common Entry Level Chemical Engineering Jobs?</h2><p>There are several common entry level chemical engineering jobs that you may be interested in pursuing.
