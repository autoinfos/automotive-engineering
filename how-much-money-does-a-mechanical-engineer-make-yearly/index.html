Do you want to know how much money does a mechanical engineer make yearly? If so, you're in the right place. In this post, we'll explore the average salary of a mechanical engineer, factors that affect their earnings, and how to maximize your earning potential.</p><p>As a mechanical engineer, you might be concerned about the salary prospects in your field. The truth is that the salary of a mechanical engineer can vary depending on various factors such as location, experience, industry, and education. However, there are some pain points you might encounter while trying to figure out how much money does a mechanical engineer make yearly.</p><p>According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median annual wage for mechanical engineers was $88,430 as of May 2020. This means that half of all mechanical engineers earned less than this amount, while the other half earned more. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $58,080, while the highest 10 percent earned more than $138,020. It's important to note that these figures are only estimates, and your actual earnings may vary.</p><p>In conclusion, a mechanical engineer's salary can vary depending on a variety of factors. However, according to the BLS, the median annual wage for mechanical engineers was $88,430 as of May 2020. To maximize your earning potential, you can focus on gaining more experience, education, and skills in your field.</p><p><h2>Factors That Affect a Mechanical Engineer's Salary</h2></p><p>Now that we've answered the question of how much money does a mechanical engineer make yearly let's take a closer look at some of the factors that can affect their earnings.</p><p><h3>Location</h3></p><p>Where you work as a mechanical engineer can have a significant impact on your earnings. For instance, if you work in a high-cost-of-living city such as San Francisco, you're likely to earn more than someone working in a low-cost-of-living area such as Birmingham. According to the BLS, the top-paying states for mechanical engineers as of May 2020 were Michigan, Alaska, and New Mexico.</p><p><h3>Experience</h3></p><p>Experience is another significant factor that can affect a mechanical engineer's salary. Generally, the more experience you have, the higher your earning potential. For instance, an entry-level mechanical engineer with less than one year of experience might earn an average of $64,000 per year, while a mechanical engineer with 20 or more years of experience might earn an average of $106,000 per year.</p><p><h3>Industry</h3></p><p>The industry you work in as a mechanical engineer can also affect your salary. For instance, according to the BLS, the top-paying industries for mechanical engineers as of May 2020 were scientific research and development services, oil and gas extraction, and navigational, measuring, electromedical, and control instruments manufacturing.</p><p><h3>Education</h3></p><p>Your education level can also play a role in determining your salary as a mechanical engineer. Generally, those with higher education levels such as a master's or doctoral degree tend to earn more than those with a bachelor's degree or lower. According to the BLS, as of May 2020, mechanical engineers with a master's degree earned a median annual wage of $97,820, while those with a bachelor's degree earned a median annual wage of $87,370.</p><p><h2>Personal Experience</h2></p><p>As a mechanical engineer with over 10 years of experience, I can attest that the factors mentioned above play a critical role in determining your salary as a mechanical engineer. When I started my career, I earned an average salary of $65,000 per year. However, as I gained more experience, my earning potential increased significantly.
