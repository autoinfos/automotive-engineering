For example, wages can be influenced by location, experience, the type of equipment being operated, and the industry in which the operator is employed.</p><p>So, what can you expect to earn as a heavy equipment operator in Canada? The answer to this question will depend on a variety of factors. However, we can provide you with some general information about wages in this field.</p><p>In this article, we'll take a closer look at heavy equipment operator wages in Canada.

This means that half of all heavy equipment operators earn less than $25 per hour, while the other half earn more.</p><p>It's important to note that this is just a median wage, and that wages can vary greatly depending on a number of factors. For example, heavy equipment operators who work in the mining and oil and gas industries tend to earn higher wages than those who work in construction or public works.

Employers are willing to pay more for operators who have a proven track record of safely and efficiently operating heavy equipment.</p><p><h3>Type of Equipment</h3></p><p>The type of equipment that you're operating can also influence your wages. For example, operators who are skilled at operating more complex equipment, such as excavators or bulldozers, may be able to command a higher wage than those who only operate simpler equipment, such as skid steers or backhoes.</p><p><h3>Industry</h3></p><p>The industry in which you're employed can also influence your wages. As we mentioned earlier, heavy equipment operators who work in the mining and oil and gas industries tend to earn higher wages than those who work in construction or public works.</p><p><h4>How to Increase Your Heavy Equipment Operator Wages in Canada</h4></p><p>If you're looking to increase your earning potential as a heavy equipment operator in Canada, there are a number of things that you can do.
