Additionally, the work itself can be physically demanding and require a high level of technical skill.</p><p>So, how much can you expect to earn as an appliance repair technician? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for appliance repair technicians was $40,080 as of May 2020.

For example, those who focus on repairing high-end appliances like refrigerators and ovens may be able to command higher salaries than those who work on more basic appliances like washing machines and dryers.</p><p>Additionally, some technicians may specialize in repairing commercial appliances rather than residential ones.

These can include:</p><ul><li>Region: Salaries can vary depending on where you work, with some regions offering higher pay than others.</li><li>Employer: Some employers may offer higher salaries or better benefits than others, so it's worth considering this when job hunting.</li><li>Certifications: Earning industry certifications or completing training programs can help you stand out from other job applicants and potentially earn a higher salary.</li></ul><h4>Tips for Maximizing Your Appliance Repair Technician Salary</h4><p>If you're interested in becoming an appliance repair technician and want to maximize your earning potential, there are a few things you can do.
