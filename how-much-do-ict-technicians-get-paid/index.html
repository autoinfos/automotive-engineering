For example, those who work in the software publishing industry tend to earn more than those who work in other sectors. Additionally, those who work in large metropolitan areas may earn more than those who work in rural areas or smaller cities.</p><h4>How to Negotiate Your Salary</h4><p>If you're offered a job as an ICT technician and feel that the salary being offered is too low, there are several steps you can take to negotiate a better offer. First, do your research and find out what the average salary is for someone in your position with your level of experience and education. Use this information to make a case for a higher salary.
