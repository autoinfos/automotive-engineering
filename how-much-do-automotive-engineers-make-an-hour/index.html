<meta name="description" content="mechanical engineering salary san francisco alangishalAre you curious about how much money automotive engineers make per hour? If so, you are not alone. Many people are interested in this topic for various reasons. For example, if you are considering a career in automotive engineering or want to hire an automotive engineer for your project, you need to know how much they make per hour. In this blog post, we will answer this question and provide some additional information about the topic.Automotive engineering is a complex field that requires a high level of technical skills, knowledge, and experience. It is no surprise that the salary for automotive engineers is relatively high compared to other professions. However, the exact amount of money that automotive engineers make per hour varies depending on several factors such as location, education, experience, and industry. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median hourly wage for automotive engineers was $44.50 in May 2020. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $26.10 per hour, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $67.60 per hour. Additionally, the annual salary for automotive engineers ranged from $56,480 to $140,760, depending on the factors mentioned earlier.My Personal ExperienceAs an automotive engineer with over 10 years of experience, I can attest that the salary range mentioned above is accurate. However, it is essential to note that the salary varies significantly depending on the industry and location. For example, automotive engineers working in the aerospace industry tend to earn more than those working in the automotive industry. Similarly, automotive engineers working in California earn more than those working in other states due to the high cost of living in California.Factors That Affect the Salary of Automotive EngineersAs mentioned earlier, several factors affect the salary of automotive engineers. The following are some of the most significant factors:Education and ExperienceGenerally, automotive engineers with advanced degrees and more experience tend to earn more than those with less education and experience. Therefore, it is essential to invest in your education and gain as much experience as possible if you want to increase your earning potential.IndustryAs mentioned earlier, the industry in which an automotive engineer works significantly affects their salary.
