Even if an internship is unpaid, it can provide valuable experience that can help you land a job in the future. Look for dealership internships in your area and apply to them. Make sure to highlight any relevant skills or experience you have, even if it's not directly related to the automotive industry.</p><h4>Volunteer Work</h4><p>Volunteering is another way to gain experience and build connections. Look for opportunities to volunteer at local dealerships or automotive events. This can help you get noticed by industry professionals and may lead to job opportunities in the future.</p><h2>Question and Answer:</h2><p><strong>Q: Do I need a degree to work in a dealership?</strong></p><p>A: No, a degree is not necessary to work in a dealership.
