<meta name="description" content="How to an Auto Mechanic Career, Salary &amp; Training (2022)Are you considering becoming a certified mechanic? Or are you a certified mechanic wondering if you&#39;re being paid fairly? Whatever the case may be, it&#39;s important to know how much a certified mechanic can expect to make. In this blog post, we&#39;ll dive into the topic of how much does a certified mechanic make and related keywords.It&#39;s no secret that the automotive industry can be a challenging field to work in. Mechanics often work long hours, deal with difficult customers, and have to keep up with constantly changing technology. On top of that, there&#39;s the question of how much a certified mechanic can expect to make. The answer to this question can depend on a variety of factors, such as location, experience, and the type of certification held.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for automotive service technicians and mechanics was $44,050 as of May 2020. However, the lowest 10 percent earned less than $25,710, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $70,820. The type of certification held can also impact earnings. For example, those who hold an ASE Master Technician Certification can earn more than those who hold only one or two ASE certifications.In summary, a certified mechanic can expect to make a median annual wage of $44,050, with the potential to earn more based on experience, location, and type of certification held.How much does a Certified Mechanic Make in Practice?As a certified mechanic myself, I can attest to the fact that earnings can vary greatly depending on location and experience. When I was working in a small town in the Midwest, I was making around $35,000 per year as a certified technician with two ASE certifications. However, when I moved to a larger city on the East Coast and gained more experience, my earnings increased to around $60,000 per year.It&#39;s also worth noting that some dealerships and independent repair shops may offer performance-based incentives, which can increase earnings even further. These incentives may be based on factors such as customer satisfaction, productivity, and overall revenue generated.Factors that Affect Earnings for Certified MechanicsAs mentioned earlier, there are several factors that can impact how much a certified mechanic can expect to make.

For example, mechanics working in areas with a higher cost of living may earn more than those working in areas with a lower cost of living. Additionally, some states or regions may have a higher demand for mechanics, which can drive up earnings.ExperienceExperience is another major factor that can impact earnings for certified mechanics. Those who are just starting out in the field will likely earn less than those who have been working as mechanics for several years. However, as mechanics gain more experience and develop their skills, their earnings are likely to increase.Additional CertificationsAs mentioned earlier, holding additional certifications can also impact earnings for certified mechanics. For example, those who hold an ASE Master Technician Certification can earn more than those who hold only one or two ASE certifications. Other certifications, such as those offered by manufacturers, may also impact earnings.Question and AnswerQ: Do certified mechanics make more than non-certified mechanics? A: Generally, yes. Certified mechanics have demonstrated their knowledge and skills through a standardized test, which can make them more valuable to employers. However, there are some non-certified mechanics who have gained extensive experience and knowledge in the field, which can also make them valuable employees.Q: What is the average hourly wage for a certified mechanic?

The answer to this question can depend on a variety of factors, such as location, experience, and the type of certification held.</p><p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for automotive service technicians and mechanics was $44,050 as of May 2020. However, the lowest 10 percent earned less than $25,710, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $70,820. The type of certification held can also impact earnings. For example, those who hold an ASE Master Technician Certification can earn more than those who hold only one or two ASE certifications.</p><p>In summary, a certified mechanic can expect to make a median annual wage of $44,050, with the potential to earn more based on experience, location, and type of certification held.</p><p><h2>How much does a Certified Mechanic Make in Practice?</h2></p><p>As a certified mechanic myself, I can attest to the fact that earnings can vary greatly depending on location and experience. When I was working in a small town in the Midwest, I was making around $35,000 per year as a certified technician with two ASE certifications. However, when I moved to a larger city on the East Coast and gained more experience, my earnings increased to around $60,000 per year.</p><p>It's also worth noting that some dealerships and independent repair shops may offer performance-based incentives, which can increase earnings even further. These incentives may be based on factors such as customer satisfaction, productivity, and overall revenue generated.</p><p><h2>Factors that Affect Earnings for Certified Mechanics</h2></p><p>As mentioned earlier, there are several factors that can impact how much a certified mechanic can expect to make. These factors include:</p><p><h3>Location</h3></p><p>Location can play a big role in earnings for certified mechanics. For example, mechanics working in areas with a higher cost of living may earn more than those working in areas with a lower cost of living. Additionally, some states or regions may have a higher demand for mechanics, which can drive up earnings.</p><p><h4>Experience</h4></p><p>Experience is another major factor that can impact earnings for certified mechanics. Those who are just starting out in the field will likely earn less than those who have been working as mechanics for several years. However, as mechanics gain more experience and develop their skills, their earnings are likely to increase.</p><p><h2>Additional Certifications</h2></p><p>As mentioned earlier, holding additional certifications can also impact earnings for certified mechanics. For example, those who hold an ASE Master Technician Certification can earn more than those who hold only one or two ASE certifications. Other certifications, such as those offered by manufacturers, may also impact earnings.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><b>Q: Do certified mechanics make more than non-certified mechanics?</b><br> A: Generally, yes. Certified mechanics have demonstrated their knowledge and skills through a standardized test, which can make them more valuable to employers. However, there are some non-certified mechanics who have gained extensive experience and knowledge in the field, which can also make them valuable employees.</p><p><b>Q: What is the average hourly wage for a certified mechanic?</b><br> A: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean hourly wage for automotive service technicians and mechanics was $22.14 as of May 2020.</p><p><b>Q: Is it necessary to be certified to work as a mechanic?</b><br> A: No, it is not necessary to be certified to work as a mechanic. However, certification can demonstrate a mechanic's knowledge and skills to potential employers and customers.</p><p><b>Q: Can mechanics earn a salary instead of hourly wages?</b><br> A: Yes, some mechanics may be paid a salary instead of hourly wages. This can depend on the employer and the type of work being performed.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of How Much Does a Certified Mechanic Make</h2></p><p>Overall, a certified mechanic can expect to make a median annual wage of $44,050, with the potential to earn more based on experience, location, and type of certification held. While earnings can vary greatly depending on these factors, certification can demonstrate a mechanic's knowledge and skills to potential employers and customers, which can lead to increased earnings in the long run.</p></article>
