You're not alone. Many people want to know how much they can expect to make as a new civil engineer. In this post, we'll answer that question and provide additional information about the topic.</p><p>As a new civil engineer, you may have concerns about your earning potential. It's natural to wonder if your salary will be enough to cover your expenses and support your lifestyle. Additionally, you may be curious about the earning potential for civil engineers in different industries and locations.</p><p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for civil engineers was $87,060 as of May 2020. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $56,540, while the highest 10 percent earned more than $144,560.

However, this figure can vary depending on various factors. Let's take a closer look at some of these factors.</p><h2>Location Matters</h2><p>The location of your job can have a significant impact on your salary.

Generally, civil engineers with advanced degrees, such as a master's degree or a Ph.D., tend to earn higher salaries than those with only a bachelor's degree. However, it's important to note that obtaining an advanced degree can also be expensive, so it's important to weigh the potential benefits against the costs.</p><h4>Negotiation Skills</h4><p>Finally, your negotiation skills can also impact your salary as a civil engineer.

Those working in the waste management industry had the lowest median salary, at $74,000.</p><h3>Location Insights</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, location can also impact your salary as a civil engineer. According to the same survey, civil engineers working in California had the highest median salary, at $116,000. Those working in South Dakota had the lowest median salary, at $62,000.</p><h4>Salary Negotiation Tips</h4><p>When negotiating your salary as a civil engineer, it's important to do your research and know your worth. Additionally, it's important to be confident and assertive during the negotiation process. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Research the average salary for civil engineers in your location and industry</li><li>Highlight your experience and education level</li><li>Be confident and assertive during the negotiation process</li><li>Consider negotiating other benefits, such as flexible work hours or additional vacation time</li></ul><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h3>Q: How much does a civil engineer make per hour?</h3><p>A: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean hourly wage for civil engineers as of May 2020 was $41.84.</p><h3>Q: What skills do I need to be a civil engineer?</h3><p>A: Some of the key skills for civil engineers include problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and attention to detail.</p><h3>Q: Do civil engineers make a lot of money?</h3><p>A: Civil engineers can earn a good salary, with the median annual salary being $87,060 as of May 2020.
