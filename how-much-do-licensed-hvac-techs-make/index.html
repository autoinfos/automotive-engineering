HVAC Career Now" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><center><figcaption><strong><u>How Much Do HVAC Jobs Pay In 2020? HVAC Career Now</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Are you interested in becoming a licensed HVAC technician? Are you wondering how much you can expect to make in this field? If so, you're in the right place. In this post, we'll explore the average salary for licensed HVAC techs and discuss what factors can impact your earning potential in this profession.</p><p>One of the biggest pain points for those considering a career in HVAC is uncertainty about salary. It's natural to want to know how much you can expect to make before committing to a training program or apprenticeship. Fortunately, there is plenty of data available to help you get a better sense of what licensed HVAC techs typically earn.</p><p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration mechanics and installers was $50,590 as of May 2020. However, this number can vary depending on a variety of factors, such as your level of experience, the region where you work, and the type of employer you work for.</p><h2>My Experience with HVAC Salary</h2><p>When I first started working as an HVAC technician, I was making around $40,000 per year. However, as I gained more experience and developed a reputation for quality work, I was able to negotiate higher wages. Today, I earn over $60,000 annually and have a steady stream of clients who trust me to handle their HVAC needs.</p><h2>Factors That Impact HVAC Salaries</h2><p>While the median annual wage for HVAC techs is a good starting point, it's important to remember that many factors can impact your earning potential in this field. For example, HVAC techs who work in large cities or affluent suburbs may be able to command higher wages than those who work in rural areas or small towns.</p><p>Your level of experience and training can also play a role in determining your salary. HVAC techs who have completed a formal apprenticeship or certification program may be able to earn more than those who have only on-the-job training. Additionally, those who specialize in niche areas such as geothermal heating and cooling or solar panel installation may be able to charge higher rates for their services.</p><h3>Other Factors to Consider</h3><p>Other factors that can impact HVAC salaries include the type of employer you work for and the demand for HVAC services in your area. HVAC techs who work for large commercial or industrial clients may be able to earn more than those who work for residential customers. Additionally, if there is high demand for HVAC services in your area, you may be able to charge more for your services.</p><h4>The Bottom Line</h4><p>So, how much do licensed HVAC techs make? The answer is, it depends. While the median annual wage for HVAC techs is around $50,000, many factors can impact your earning potential in this field. However, with the right training and experience, it's possible to earn a comfortable living as an HVAC technician.</p><h2>My Advice for Aspiring HVAC Techs</h2><p>If you're interested in becoming an HVAC technician, my advice is to focus on developing your skills and building a reputation for quality work. Look for opportunities to gain experience and training, and don't be afraid to negotiate for higher wages as you become more experienced. With hard work and dedication, you can build a successful career in this field.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: Do licensed HVAC techs make more than unlicensed techs?</strong></p><p>A: In general, licensed HVAC techs can command higher wages than unlicensed techs. This is because having a license demonstrates that you have completed formal training and have demonstrated a certain level of competency in the field.</p><p><strong>Q: Do HVAC techs get paid overtime?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, HVAC techs who work more than 40 hours in a week are typically eligible for overtime pay. The exact rate of overtime pay may depend on your employer and the laws in your state.</p><p><strong>Q: Can HVAC techs earn commission?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, some HVAC techs may be eligible for commission or performance-based pay in addition to their base salary. This is more common in sales or installation roles than in repair or maintenance roles.</p><p><strong>Q: Are HVAC techs in high demand?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, HVAC techs are in high demand in many areas of the country. This is due to factors such as population growth, aging infrastructure, and increasing demand for energy-efficient HVAC systems.</p><h2>Conclusion of How Much Do Licensed HVAC Techs Make</h2><p>If you're considering a career as an HVAC technician, it's natural to want to know how much you can expect to make. While there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, the median annual wage for HVAC techs is around $50,000. However, many factors can impact your earning potential in this field, such as your level of experience, training, and the region where you work. With the right skills and experience, it's possible to earn a comfortable living as an HVAC technician.</p></article>
