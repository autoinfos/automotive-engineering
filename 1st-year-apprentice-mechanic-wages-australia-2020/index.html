This can be a significant pain point for many, especially when considering the cost of living in some parts of the country. It's also important to note that the wage can vary depending on your location, the type of employer you work for, and the qualifications you already have.</p><p>The average starting wage for first-year apprentice mechanics in Australia in 2020 is around $13.50 per hour. This equates to around $500 per week, before tax.

For example, the Australian government offers incentives to employers who take on apprentices, including wage subsidies and support for training costs. Additionally, some employers may offer additional benefits, such as tools and uniforms, to help offset the cost of starting your apprenticeship.</p><h4>How to Negotiate Your Wage</h4><p>If you feel that your starting wage as a first-year apprentice mechanic is too low, you may be able to negotiate with your employer. However, it's important to approach this conversation in a professional manner and be prepared to demonstrate your value to the company. For example, you may be able to negotiate a higher wage if you have prior experience in a related field, or if you have completed relevant training or qualifications.</p><h2>FAQs About 1st Year Apprentice Mechanic Wages Australia 2020</h2><p><strong>Q: Can I expect my wage to increase during my apprenticeship?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, your wage will increase as you progress through your apprenticeship and gain more experience.</p><p><strong>Q: How can I offset the cost of a low starting wage?</strong></p><p>A: There are a range of incentives available to apprentices in Australia, including government wage subsidies and employer support for training costs.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I negotiate my starting wage?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you may be able to negotiate your starting wage with your employer, but it's important to approach this conversation in a professional manner and be prepared to demonstrate your value to the company.</p><p><strong>Q: How important are qualifications for earning a higher wage as a mechanic?</strong></p><p>A: Qualifications are very important for increasing your earning potential as a mechanic.
