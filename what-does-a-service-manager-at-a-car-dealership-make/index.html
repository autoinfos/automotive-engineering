Or are you a current service manager looking to negotiate a higher salary? Either way, understanding what service managers at car dealerships make can be a valuable piece of information.</p><p>As a service manager at a car dealership, you can expect to face a number of challenges on a daily basis. From managing a team of technicians to ensuring customer satisfaction, the role can be both demanding and rewarding. However, when it comes to compensation, the question on many people's minds is: what does a service manager at a car dealership make?</p><p>The short answer is that service managers at car dealerships can make anywhere from $50,000 to $150,000 or more per year, depending on their level of experience, the size of the dealership, and the location of the dealership. According to Glassdoor, the national average salary for a service manager at a car dealership is $72,000 per year.</p><p>So, what factors influence a service manager's salary? Let's take a closer look.</p><h2>Location and Size of the Dealership</h2><p>The location and size of the dealership can have a significant impact on a service manager's salary. Managers at larger dealerships typically earn more than those at smaller ones, while those in metropolitan areas may earn more than those in rural areas.</p><p>I started my career as a service manager at a small dealership in a rural area and earned around $55,000 per year. However, when I moved to a larger dealership in a more urban location, my salary increased to $85,000 per year.</p><h2>Experience and Qualifications</h2><p>Experience and qualifications are also important factors in determining a service manager's salary. Those with more experience and advanced certifications, such as ASE certification or a degree in automotive technology, may earn more than those with less experience or qualifications.</p><p>After obtaining my ASE certification and gaining several years of experience as a service manager, I was able to negotiate a salary of $105,000 per year.</p><h3>Negotiation Skills</h3><p>Finally, negotiation skills can play a role in how much a service manager is able to earn. Those who are able to effectively negotiate their salary may be able to earn more than those who do not negotiate or are not as skilled in the art of negotiation.</p><p>When negotiating my salary at my current dealership, I was able to secure a salary of $125,000 per year by demonstrating my value to the dealership and highlighting my experience and qualifications.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>As you can see, the salary of a service manager at a car dealership can vary based on a number of factors, including location, size of the dealership, experience and qualifications, and negotiation skills. However, with the national average salary for a service manager at a car dealership at $72,000 per year, it can be a lucrative career path for those with the right skills and qualifications.</p><h2>Personal Experience: What Does a Service Manager at a Car Dealership Make?</h2><p>When I first started my career as a service manager at a car dealership, I was earning around $55,000 per year at a small dealership in a rural area. However, as I gained more experience and qualifications, I was able to negotiate higher salaries at larger dealerships in more urban locations.</p><p>After obtaining my ASE certification and gaining several years of experience as a service manager, I was able to negotiate a salary of $105,000 per year. And when I recently switched dealerships, I was able to negotiate a salary of $125,000 per year by demonstrating my value to the dealership and highlighting my experience and qualifications.</p><h2>FAQs About What Does a Service Manager at a Car Dealership Make:</h2><p><strong>Q: What is the national average salary for a service manager at a car dealership?</strong></p><p>A: According to Glassdoor, the national average salary for a service manager at a car dealership is $72,000 per year.</p><p><strong>Q: What factors influence a service manager's salary?</strong></p><p>A: Factors that influence a service manager's salary include location and size of the dealership, experience and qualifications, and negotiation skills.</p><p><strong>Q: Can service managers at car dealerships make six-figure salaries?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, service managers at car dealerships can make six-figure salaries, particularly those with advanced certifications and experience at larger dealerships in metropolitan areas.</p><p><strong>Q: How can I negotiate a higher salary as a service manager at a car dealership?</strong></p><p>A: To negotiate a higher salary as a service manager at a car dealership, be sure to demonstrate your value to the dealership, highlight your experience and qualifications, and be prepared to negotiate effectively.</p><h2>Conclusion of What Does a Service Manager at a Car Dealership Make</h2><p>While the salary of a service manager at a car dealership can vary based on a number of factors, it can be a lucrative career path for those with the right skills and qualifications.
