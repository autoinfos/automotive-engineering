Brake pads and rotors need to be replaced periodically, and brake fluid should be flushed every two years. Ignoring brake problems can lead to costly repairs and even accidents.</p><p>During my last brake service, I was surprised to learn that my brake fluid had never been changed, despite having my car for several years. Luckily, my mechanic caught the issue before it caused any damage.</p><p><h4>How to Choose a Reliable Garage</h4></p><p>With so many garages and service centers throughout Dubai, it can be challenging to choose the right one for your needs.
