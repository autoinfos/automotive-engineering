A Complete Career Information Guide</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p></p><p>Are you considering a career as a pharmacy technician, but wondering if you have what it takes? Maybe you're worried that you're not smart enough to handle the job. Don't worry, you're not alone. Many people have the same concerns, but the truth is that being smart is not the only requirement for the job.</p><p>One of the biggest misconceptions about pharmacy technicians is that they need to have a high level of intelligence to excel in their job. While it's true that pharmacy techs need to be detail-oriented and have good math skills, it's not necessary to be a genius to succeed in this field.</p><p>In fact, most of the skills required for pharmacy techs can be learned through a certification program or on-the-job training. These skills include knowledge of medications, drug interactions, and proper dosage calculations. It's more important to have a strong work ethic, good communication skills, and a willingness to learn than to have a high IQ.</p><p>In summary, being smart is not the only requirement for a career as a pharmacy technician. While it's important to have good math skills and attention to detail, these skills can be learned through training and experience.

However, I quickly learned that being smart wasn't the most important thing. What was most important was having a strong work ethic, good communication skills, and a willingness to learn.</p><p><h2>What Skills Do You Need to Be a Pharmacy Tech?</h2></p><p>While being smart is important, there are other skills that are equally important for a career as a pharmacy technician.
