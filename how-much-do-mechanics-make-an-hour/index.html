If yes, then you are not alone. The salary of a mechanic is a common question that many people ask.

Therefore, it's essential to know how much they make so that we can appreciate their hard work and dedication.</p><p>One of the pain points related to how much do mechanics make an hour is that people assume that they don't earn much.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median hourly wage for automotive service technicians and mechanics was $20.24 as of May 2020.

From my personal experience, I have noticed that mechanics with specialized skills tend to earn more.</p><p>For example, mechanics who specialize in diesel engines or exotic cars tend to earn more than those who work on regular cars. This is because specialized skills are in high demand, and employers are willing to pay more to keep their employees.</p><h3>Education and Certification That Affect How Much Do Mechanics Make an Hour</h3><p>The target of this section is to explain how education and certification affect how much a mechanic earns per hour. From my personal experience, I have noticed that mechanics with higher education and certification tend to earn more.</p><p>For example, mechanics with a degree in automotive technology or certification from the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) tend to earn more than those without. This is because employers value education and certification, and they are willing to pay more to hire qualified mechanics.</p><h4>How to Increase How Much Do Mechanics Make an Hour</h4><p>The target of this section is to explain how mechanics can increase their hourly wage.

Therefore, mechanics can increase their earnings by gaining more experience in the field.</p><p>The second way is to specialize in a particular area.

Therefore, mechanics can increase their earnings by specializing in a particular area.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p>Q: How much do mechanics make an hour on average?</p><p>A: The median hourly wage for automotive service technicians and mechanics was $20.24 as of May 2020.</p><p>Q: Do mechanics with more experience earn more?</p><p>A: Yes, mechanics with more experience tend to earn more than those who are just starting in the industry.</p><p>Q: Do mechanics working in big cities earn more than those working in rural areas?</p><p>A: Yes, mechanics working in big cities tend to earn more than those working in rural areas.</p><p>Q: How can mechanics increase their earnings?</p><p>A: Mechanics can increase their earnings by gaining more experience or specializing in a particular area.</p><h2>Conclusion of How Much Do Mechanics Make an Hour</h2><p>In conclusion, mechanics earn a fair wage for the hard work and dedication they put into their jobs.
