According to payscale.com, the average salary for a plant mechanic in Kenya is KES 500,000 per year.

Plant mechanics working in urban areas tend to earn more than those working in rural areas.

However, having a degree in mechanical engineering can give you a competitive advantage in the job market. Additionally, you can obtain certification from the National Industrial Training Authority (NITA) to improve your skills and increase your earning potential.</p><h4>How to Find Job Opportunities for Plant Mechanics in Kenya</h4><p>If you're looking for job opportunities as a plant mechanic in Kenya, several websites can help.
