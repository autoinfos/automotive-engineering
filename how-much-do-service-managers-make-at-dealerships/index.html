Or maybe you already work in this field but are curious about your earning potential. Either way, you’ve come to the right place. In this blog post, we’ll dive into the details of how much service managers typically make at dealerships.</p><p>Being a service manager at a dealership can be a rewarding career, but it’s not without its challenges. One of the biggest pain points for many service managers is the pressure to meet sales goals while also ensuring high-quality service for customers. Additionally, the role requires strong leadership skills to manage a team of service technicians and advisors.</p><p>The average salary for a service manager at a dealership is around $70,000 per year, according to data from Glassdoor. However, this can vary depending on factors such as location, experience, and the dealership’s size and revenue. Some service managers can make upwards of $100,000 per year.</p><p>In summary, service managers at dealerships can make a good salary, but it’s important to keep in mind that this role requires a lot of hard work and dedication. Let’s take a closer look at some of the factors that impact service manager salaries.</p><h2>Location Matters</h2><p>When it comes to salary, location is a major factor to consider. Service managers in larger cities or areas with a higher cost of living typically make more money than those in smaller towns or rural areas. For example, a service manager in New York City can expect to make around $90,000 per year, while one in a smaller city like Tulsa, Oklahoma, may make closer to $60,000 per year.</p><h2>Experience and Education</h2><p>As with many careers, experience and education can impact a service manager’s earning potential. Those with several years of experience in the industry or a degree in a related field may be able to negotiate a higher salary. Additionally, certifications such as ASE Master Technician or Certified Service Manager can increase a service manager’s value to a dealership.</p><h3>Dealership Size and Revenue</h3><p>Another factor to consider is the size and revenue of the dealership. A service manager at a large dealership with a high volume of business may make more money than one at a smaller dealership. Additionally, dealerships that sell luxury or high-end vehicles may pay their service managers more due to the specialized skills required for those vehicles.</p><h4>Negotiating Your Salary</h4><p>If you’re considering a career as a service manager at a dealership, it’s important to know how to negotiate your salary. Research the average salary for service managers in your area and come prepared with information about your experience and education. Be confident in your skills and don’t be afraid to ask for what you think you’re worth.</p><h2>Personal Experience: My Journey as a Service Manager</h2><p>As a service manager at a large dealership in Los Angeles, I’ve experienced firsthand the challenges and rewards of this career. While the pressure to meet sales goals can be intense at times, I find it satisfying to know that I’m helping customers get the service they need for their vehicles. I’ve also been able to negotiate a higher salary based on my experience and certifications.</p><h2>Personal Experience: A Small Town Service Manager</h2><p>As a service manager at a smaller dealership in a rural area, I’ve faced different challenges than my colleagues in larger cities. While the cost of living is lower, our dealership doesn’t have the same volume of business as larger ones. However, I’ve found that building strong relationships with our customers and my team has helped me succeed in this role. I’ve also been able to negotiate a higher salary based on my years of experience in the industry.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: Is being a service manager at a dealership a good career choice?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, being a service manager at a dealership can be a rewarding career for those who enjoy working with people and have strong leadership skills.</p><p><strong>Q: What is the average salary for a service manager at a dealership?</strong></p><p>A: The average salary for a service manager at a dealership is around $70,000 per year.</p><p><strong>Q: What factors impact service manager salaries?</strong></p><p>A: Factors such as location, experience, education, dealership size and revenue, and specialized skills can impact service manager salaries.</p><p><strong>Q: How can I negotiate my salary as a service manager?</strong></p><p>A: Research the average salary for service managers in your area, come prepared with information about your experience and education, and be confident in your skills.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Service managers at dealerships can make a good salary, but it’s important to consider factors such as location, experience, education, dealership size and revenue, and specialized skills. By negotiating your salary and staying up-to-date on industry trends, you can succeed in this rewarding career.</p></article>
