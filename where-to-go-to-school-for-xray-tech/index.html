If so, becoming a radiologic technologist might be the perfect fit for you. As an x-ray tech, you'll be responsible for operating imaging equipment, preparing patients for procedures, and assisting radiologists in interpreting images. But where should you go to school for x-ray tech training? In this post, we'll explore your options and help you make an informed decision.</p><p>One of the biggest pain points for aspiring x-ray techs is figuring out where to get their education. With so many programs and schools to choose from, it can be overwhelming to decide which one is right for you. Additionally, you might be worried about the cost of tuition, the time commitment required, or the job prospects after graduation.</p><p>So, where should you go to school for x-ray tech training? The answer depends on your individual needs and goals. Here are some factors to consider:</p><h2>Community Colleges and Technical Schools</h2><p>If you're looking for an affordable and flexible option, community colleges and technical schools might be a good choice. These institutions offer two-year programs that culminate in an associate's degree in radiologic technology. You'll learn the necessary skills and knowledge to become an x-ray tech, and you'll also have the opportunity to complete clinical rotations in real healthcare settings. Plus, many community colleges and technical schools offer evening and weekend classes, so you can work while you study.</p><h2>Universities and Four-Year Colleges</h2><p>For those who want to earn a bachelor's degree in radiologic technology, universities and four-year colleges offer programs that provide a more comprehensive education. In addition to x-ray tech training, you'll take courses in subjects like anatomy, physiology, and medical ethics. This type of program is ideal for those who want to pursue leadership roles in healthcare or further their education in graduate school.</p><h3>Online Programs</h3><p>If you need flexibility and convenience, an online program might be the right fit for you. Many colleges and universities now offer online degrees in radiologic technology, which allow you to complete coursework and clinical rotations from the comfort of your own home. However, it's important to make sure that the online program you choose is accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT).</p><h4>Accelerated Programs</h4><p>Finally, if you're looking to fast-track your x-ray tech training, an accelerated program might be an option. These programs are typically offered by community colleges and technical schools, and they allow you to complete your degree in as little as 12 months. However, they are intense and require a significant time commitment, so make sure you're up to the challenge before enrolling.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Community College Program</h2><p>Personally, I chose to attend a community college for my x-ray tech training, and I'm so glad I did. The program was affordable, and the instructors were knowledgeable and supportive. I also appreciated the clinical rotations, which gave me hands-on experience working with patients in a real healthcare setting. After graduating, I was able to find a job quickly, and I feel confident in my ability to provide quality care to my patients.</p><h2>Personal Experience with University Program</h2><p>On the other hand, my friend chose to attend a university for her x-ray tech training, and she also had a positive experience. She liked the comprehensive education she received, and she appreciated the opportunity to take courses in other healthcare-related subjects. While the program was more expensive than a community college, she feels that it was worth the investment.</p><h3>What to Look for in an X-ray Tech Program</h3><p>No matter where you decide to go to school for x-ray tech training, there are certain things you should look for in a program. These include:</p><p>- Accreditation by the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT)<br> - Clinical rotations in real healthcare settings<br> - Experienced and knowledgeable instructors<br> - Job placement assistance for graduates<br> - Preparation for the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) certification exam</p><h4>How to Pay for X-ray Tech School</h4><p>One of the biggest concerns for many students is how to pay for x-ray tech school. Fortunately, there are several options available, including:</p><p>- Federal financial aid (FAFSA)<br> - Scholarships and grants<br> - Private loans<br> - Employer tuition reimbursement programs</p><h2>Personal Experience with Paying for School</h2><p>Personally, I was able to pay for my x-ray tech training through a combination of federal financial aid and scholarships. I also worked part-time while I was in school to help cover my living expenses. My friend, on the other hand, took out a private loan to pay for her university program, but she was able to pay it off quickly after graduating thanks to her high-paying job.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: Is it possible to become an x-ray tech without going to school?</strong><br> A: No, in order to become an x-ray tech, you must complete an accredited educational program and pass the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) certification exam.</p><p><strong>Q: How long does it take to become an x-ray tech?</strong><br> A: It typically takes about two years to complete an associate's degree program in radiologic technology, or four years to complete a bachelor's degree program.</p><p><strong>Q: What is the job outlook for x-ray techs?</strong><br> A: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of radiologic technologists is projected to grow 7 percent from 2019 to 2029, faster than the average for all occupations.</p><p><strong>Q: How much do x-ray techs make?</strong><br> A: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for radiologic technologists was $62,280 in May 2020.</p><h2>Conclusion of Where to Go to School for X-ray Tech</h2><p>Choosing where to go to school for x-ray tech training is an important decision that will impact your career for years to come. By considering your individual needs and goals, researching different programs, and asking questions, you can make an informed decision that will set you up for success. Whether you choose a community college, university, online program, or accelerated program, remember to look for accreditation, clinical rotations, experienced instructors, job placement assistance, and preparation for the certification exam. With hard work and dedication, you can become an x-ray tech and make a difference in patients' lives.</p></article>
