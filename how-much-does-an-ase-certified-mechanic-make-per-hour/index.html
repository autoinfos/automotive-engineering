Well, you're in the right place! In this article, we'll delve into the topic of how much does an ASE certified mechanic make per hour and provide you with some valuable insights.</p><p>One of the biggest pain points for individuals considering a career as a mechanic is the uncertainty surrounding their potential earnings. This is a valid concern, as the automotive industry can be highly competitive, and the earnings of a mechanic can vary greatly based on their level of expertise, experience, and certifications.</p><p>So, how much does an ASE certified mechanic make per hour? The answer is not straightforward, as the earnings of an ASE certified mechanic can depend on various factors. However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median hourly wage for automotive service technicians and mechanics in the United States was $20.24 as of May 2020. </p><p>In summary, becoming an ASE certified mechanic can lead to an increase in earnings potential, but the actual amount you can make per hour can depend on several factors. In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into this topic and provide you with more information.</p><h2>What is ASE Certification?</h2><p>Before we delve deeper into the earnings potential of an ASE certified mechanic, let's first briefly discuss what ASE certification is. ASE stands for the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence, and it is a non-profit organization that tests and certifies automotive professionals.</p><p>ASE certification is a widely recognized standard of competency in the automotive industry, and it can be a valuable asset for mechanics looking to advance their careers. ASE certified mechanics are required to pass a series of tests that assess their knowledge and skills in various areas of automotive repair and service.</p><h2>Earnings Potential of an ASE Certified Mechanic</h2><p>Now that we've established what ASE certification is, let's dive into the earnings potential of an ASE certified mechanic. As mentioned earlier, the earnings of an ASE certified mechanic can depend on various factors such as their level of expertise, experience, and certifications.</p><p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median hourly wage for automotive service technicians and mechanics in the United States was $20.24 as of May 2020. However, ASE certified mechanics can earn significantly more than this amount. In fact, ASE certified mechanics reportedly earn an average of $9,000 more per year than non-certified mechanics.</p><h3>Factors That Can Affect Earnings</h3><p>While becoming an ASE certified mechanic can increase your earnings potential, it's important to note that your actual earnings can depend on several factors. Here are some of the main factors that can affect the earnings of an ASE certified mechanic:</p><h4>Level of Expertise</h4><p>The level of expertise of a mechanic can significantly impact their earnings potential. Mechanics who have specialized knowledge or skills in a particular area of automotive repair or service may be able to command higher wages than those who do not.</p><h4>Experience</h4><p>The level of experience of a mechanic can also impact their earnings potential. Mechanics who have been in the industry for several years and have a proven track record of success may be able to command higher wages than those who are just starting out.</p><h4>Geographic Location</h4><p>The geographic location of a mechanic can also impact their earnings potential. Mechanics who work in areas with a high cost of living may be able to command higher wages than those who work in areas with a lower cost of living.</p><h2>A Personal Experience</h2><p>I've been working as an ASE certified mechanic for over a decade now, and I can say that becoming certified has definitely helped me increase my earnings potential. When I first started out in the industry, I was making around $15 per hour. However, after becoming ASE certified and gaining more experience and expertise, I now make over $25 per hour.</p><p>The key to increasing your earnings potential as an ASE certified mechanic is to continually improve your knowledge and skills. Attend training sessions, stay up-to-date on the latest automotive technologies, and strive to provide excellent service to your customers. Doing so can help you stand out in a competitive industry and increase your earnings potential.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Do ASE certified mechanics make more than non-certified mechanics?</h3><p>A: Yes, ASE certified mechanics reportedly earn an average of $9,000 more per year than non-certified mechanics.</p><h3>Q: How do I become ASE certified?</h3><p>A: To become ASE certified, you must pass a series of tests that assess your knowledge and skills in various areas of automotive repair and service. You can find more information on the ASE website.</p><h3>Q: Can I become an ASE certified mechanic without formal training?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can become ASE certified without formal training. However, formal training can help you gain the knowledge and skills needed to pass the ASE tests and advance your career.</p><h3>Q: Can I still work as a mechanic without ASE certification?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can still work as a mechanic without ASE certification. However, becoming certified can increase your earnings potential and help you stand out in a competitive industry.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Becoming an ASE certified mechanic can be a great way to increase your earnings potential in the automotive industry. While the actual amount you can make per hour can depend on various factors, including your level of expertise, experience, and geographic location, ASE certification can help you stand out in a competitive industry and earn more than non-certified mechanics.</p></article>
