If you're considering a career in the field of engineering, it's important to understand the potential salary range for this role. In this blog post, we'll dive into the topic of how much engineering techs make, including the factors that can impact their salary, and what you can expect to earn in this field.</p><h2>The Pain Points of How Much Do Engineering Techs Make</h2><p>One of the biggest pain points related to how much engineering techs make is the wide range of potential salaries in this field. The amount you can earn as an engineering tech can vary depending on your experience, education, location, and the specific industry you work in. This can make it difficult to know what to expect in terms of salary when you're just starting out in your career.</p><h2>Answering the Question: How Much Do Engineering Techs Make?</h2><p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for engineering technicians was $58,240 as of May 2020. This means that half of all engineering technicians earned more than this amount, while the other half earned less. The lowest 10 percent of engineering technicians earned less than $37,690 per year, while the highest 10 percent earned more than $91,620 per year.</p><p>It's important to note that these figures can vary depending on factors such as your level of education, experience, and the industry you work in. For example, engineering technicians working in the aerospace industry tend to earn higher salaries than those working in other industries.</p><h2>Summary of Main Points</h2><p>In summary, engineering techs can earn a wide range of salaries depending on their experience, education, location, and industry. The median annual wage for engineering technicians was $58,240 as of May 2020, with the lowest 10 percent earning less than $37,690 per year and the highest 10 percent earning more than $91,620 per year.</p><h2>Factors That Impact Salaries for Engineering Techs</h2><p>As mentioned, the amount you can earn as an engineering tech can vary depending on a range of factors. Some of the most common factors that impact salaries for engineering techs include:</p><p><strong>Education:</strong> Generally, engineering techs with more education (such as a bachelor's degree) tend to earn higher salaries than those with less education.</p><p><strong>Experience:</strong> The more experience you have as an engineering tech, the higher your potential salary may be. Engineers with more than 20 years of experience can earn six-figure salaries.</p><p><strong>Industry:</strong> The industry you work in can also impact your salary as an engineering tech. For example, engineering techs working in the aerospace industry tend to earn higher salaries than those working in other industries.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Salaries for engineering techs can also vary depending on your location.
