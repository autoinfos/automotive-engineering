Some of the most common types of questions include:1. What is an IC engine, and how does it work?Answer: An IC engine is a heat engine that converts chemical energy into mechanical energy. It works by burning fuel to produce high-pressure gases, which in turn move a piston. This movement is then converted into rotational motion, which powers the vehicle.2. What are the different types of IC engines?Answer: There are two main types of IC engines: petrol engines and diesel engines. Petrol engines use a spark to ignite the fuel, while diesel engines use compression to ignite the fuel.3. What is the difference between a petrol engine and a diesel engine?Answer: The main difference between a petrol engine and a diesel engine is the way in which fuel is ignited. In a petrol engine, fuel is ignited by a spark, while in a diesel engine, fuel is ignited by compression.4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an IC engine?Answer: The advantages of using an IC engine include high efficiency, good power output, and low cost. The disadvantages include high emissions, noise pollution, and the need for regular maintenance.Conclusion of IC Engine Interview Questions PDFThe IC engine interview questions PDF is an essential resource for anyone who wants to prepare for an interview related to IC engines.
