The answer can vary depending on a range of factors, including experience, location, and specialization. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for automotive service technicians and mechanics was $44,050 as of May 2020. However, experienced BMW technicians can earn significantly more than this, with some earning six-figure salaries.</p><h2>Summary of Main Points</h2><p>In summary, BMW technicians can earn a competitive salary that allows them to support themselves and their families.
