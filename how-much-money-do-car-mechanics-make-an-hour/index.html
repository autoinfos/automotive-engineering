Or maybe you&#39;re already a mechanic but not sure if you&#39;re being paid what you&#39;re worth. Whatever the case may be, understanding how much money car mechanics make an hour is an important consideration.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median hourly wage for automotive service technicians and mechanics is $20.24 per hour as of May 2020.
