Attention to Detail</h4><p>As a mechanic, you need to have excellent attention to detail. You need to be able to notice small details that others may overlook, as these details can provide valuable insights into the problem at hand.</p><p>One time, I was working on a car, and I noticed that a small wire was frayed.
