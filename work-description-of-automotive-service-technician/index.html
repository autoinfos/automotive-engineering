After running some tests, I discovered that the problem was with the battery. I explained the issue to the customer and let them know that we would need to replace the battery. I also communicated with my team members to ensure that everyone was aware of the issue.</p><h4>Testing Vehicles to Ensure They're Working Properly</h4><p>Finally, as an automotive service technician, you'll be responsible for testing vehicles to ensure that they're working properly before returning them to the customer. This involves taking the vehicle for a test drive and checking to make sure that all systems are functioning correctly.</p><p>After repairing a customer's car, I always take it for a test drive to ensure that everything is working as it should be.
