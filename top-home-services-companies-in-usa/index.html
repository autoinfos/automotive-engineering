Handy</h2><p>Handy is a popular home services company that offers cleaning, handyman, and plumbing services across the USA.

I was able to read reviews and compare prices before making a decision, which made the whole process much less stressful.</p><h3>3. TaskRabbit</h3><p>TaskRabbit is a unique home services company that connects homeowners with "Taskers" - independent contractors who can help with a variety of tasks, from cleaning and moving to furniture assembly and home repairs. I used TaskRabbit to assemble a new bookshelf, and was impressed with the speed and quality of the work. The Tasker arrived on time, had all the necessary tools, and completed the job in under an hour.</p><h4>4. Amazon Home Services</h4><p>Amazon Home Services is a newer player in the home services industry, but has quickly gained popularity thanks to the convenience of its online platform. You can browse services, compare prices, and schedule appointments all in one place. I used Amazon Home Services to hire a handyman to fix a leaky faucet, and was impressed with the quality of the work and the reasonable price.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p>Q: How do I know if a home services company is reliable?</p><p>A: Look for companies that are licensed and insured, and that have positive reviews from previous customers. You can also check with the Better Business Bureau to see if any complaints have been filed against the company.</p><p>Q: Are home services companies expensive?</p><p>A: Prices can vary depending on the type of service you need and the company you choose. However, many companies offer competitive pricing and discounts for repeat customers.</p><p>Q: How do I schedule a service with a home services company?</p><p>A: Most companies allow you to schedule services online or over the phone. Some also offer mobile apps that make scheduling and payment even more convenient.</p><p>Q: What if I'm not satisfied with the service I receive?</p><p>A: Look for companies that offer satisfaction guarantees, which allow you to get your money back if you're not happy with the work. You can also leave reviews and feedback to help other homeowners make informed decisions.</p><h2>Conclusion of Top Home Services Companies in USA</h2><p>Overall, top home services companies in the USA offer a valuable and convenient solution to homeowners who need help with repairs and maintenance.
